**Air Quality Index and Weather Data Idea Evaluation:**
1. Mobile Experience:
   - The mobile experience is integral to your app because it leverages real-time data such as AQI and weather, which is location-specific and constantly changing. Mobile apps can use GPS to provide personalized weather and AQI information, making it uniquely mobile.

2. Uniqueness:
   - This app is more than a glorified website because it provides location-specific data in real-time. It offers features that take advantage of the user's mobile device, such as geolocation to deliver precise information. This uniqueness is a key selling point.

3. Story and Value:
   - The story around this app may not be as compelling as some entertainment or social apps, but it appeals to users who care about their health and well-being or those planning outdoor activities. The value is clear: it helps users make informed decisions based on air quality and weather conditions.

4. Friends and Peers:
   - The response from friends and peers would likely depend on their personal interests. Those concerned about air quality and weather may find it useful, while others may not see it as particularly exciting.

5. Market:
   - The market for this app is substantial, as it appeals to a wide range of users interested in weather forecasts and air quality, especially in areas with air quality concerns. It's not a niche app and can have a broad user base.

6. User Base:
   - The size and scale of the potential user base can be significant, especially in areas with varying weather conditions and air quality issues. It's not limited to a niche group but can be used by the general population.

7. Habit-Forming:
   - The habit-forming nature of the app may not be very high. Users would open the app as needed, mainly for checking weather and air quality. They would consume information rather than creating something, so it may not be highly addictive.

8. Scope:
   - The scope of this app is well-defined and relatively straightforward. It involves pulling data from APIs, displaying it to users, and potentially offering some basic features like location-based alerts. It is not expected to be technically challenging, and a stripped-down version can still be interesting to build.

9. Technical Challenge:
   - Building this app is not expected to be highly technically challenging, given the availability of APIs for weather and AQI data. It can be completed within a reasonable timeframe, provided you have the necessary development skills.

10. Product Definition:
    - The product you want to build is clear and focused on delivering real-time weather and air quality information to users.

In summary, this app offers a unique mobile experience, has a clear value to a broad audience, has a substantial market potential, and a well-defined scope. It may not be highly habit-forming, but it provides valuable information to users. Your friends and peers' response may vary based on their interests.

**Company Info App Idea Evaluation:**

1. Mobile:

    - The product experience is uniquely mobile because it should be easy to use and only display the most important information of a company that a user might need. It should essentially cut out the "white noise" that other job search/company information applications offer, which often ends up overwelming a user base that might not need all the irrelevant information.

2. Story:

    - The origin of this idea lies in the mind-numbing experience that is the internship search. This app should serve as a useful tool to our friends and peers that are also students in college. It's main goal is to educate and assist students in the transition from academia to the professional sphere. It should therefore be welcomed by those at this similar stage in life. 

3. Market: 

    - While the market for this app, university students, might not be the most unique, it is quite large. University students, typically from the ages of 18 to 22, should find this app useful in their internship and job search.  

4. Habit: 

    - This app, which will be made by students for students, is designed to not be addictive. It's main goal is to educate and improve productivity. With that said, the average user should open and use this app anytime they come across an internship or job opening from a company they have not heard of. It could also be used as a study guide of sorts right before a behavorial interview, where companies might factor in how much a student knows into their hiring decision. Given that most students need to send out hundreds of applications before landing their first internship or full-time offers, the app should see alot of use. 


5. Scope:

    - A stripped down version is perfectly buildable by the deadline. It also shouldn't be too technically challenging given that most team members have some knowledge of Android development even if they are not experts. In addition to this, while a minimum viable product will allow us to demonstrate our proof of concept, the idea allows for further expansion past the deadline for members interested in working on it afterwards.
